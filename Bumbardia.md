**Project description:** An iOS infinite bomber take on the infinite runner genre of casual games, previously available on the App Store. Providing air support, you defend Larry, Barry, Harry, and Joe helping them go as far as they can, as they fight to take back the land taken from them by the Evil Imperial Army. Also, a helping hand will provide vehicle drops aiding in the battle, after you cause a great amount of destruction.

Featuring wacky characters and an arsenal of weapons, Bümbardia™ allows for varying styles of play. Aid your friendlies strategically through coordinated precision or just blast in like a bull in a china shop destroying everything in your path.
