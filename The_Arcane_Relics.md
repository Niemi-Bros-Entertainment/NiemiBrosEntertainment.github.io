**Project description:** In The Arcane Relics™, you are cast into the land of Terradim – a land full of wonder, mystery, & great danger. Assume the role of any type of character you wish in this wacky fantasy-medieval sandbox experience, featuring 4-player split-screen mayhem!

The game features strategic combat where hits can be placed on specific limbs, crippling them, and characters are limited in action via stamina. This is to prevent hacking with heavy weapons or blocking every attack with a dagger. Armor pieces also slow down the wearer and only protect the limbs that they cover.

The end goal of this project is to make a dynamic fantasy sandbox with hand-crafted environments and an emphasis on cooperative multiplayer.

The Arcane Relics™ was Greenlit [(_Steam Greenlight Page_)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=504642943) on Steam back in 2016, and we've since released 3 demo versions to the public. Platforms include: PC and Mac. Currently, we are working towards the next version (_v0.3_).
