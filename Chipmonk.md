**Project description:** The gluttonous gray squirrel has stolen all the land's food stores, threatening the forest’s inhabitants with starvation. Embark on a perilous journey as a chipmunk warrior — Grey, Cheeks or Red — as you battle a multitude of foes in a heroic attempt to recover the stolen food. Go nuts and fill your cheeks! Chipmonk! is a throwback to the popular late 80s game genre known as Beat ‘em up. Inspired by classics such as Golden Axe, Battletoads, and Streets of Rage (Bare Knuckle in Japan), Chipmonk! features local multiplayer, multiple playable characters, an assortment of villains, and a retro pixel aesthetic. Although Chipmonk! includes many hallmarks of the genre, it also introduces a variety of new moves, challenges, and quirks.

Chipmonk! features local multiplayer for up to 2 players, 3-playable characters, a variety of moves, an assortment of villains, and a retro pixel aesthetic. Battle your way through the 4 seasons on your way to the gluttonous gray squirrel’s lair.
